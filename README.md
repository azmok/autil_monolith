# Autil
Vital functions for PHP7 development

# How to use
- Go to **'@Test/Autil.test.php'** file
- Read and follow instructions in that file.

# Who this is for
I write this functions for my personal use. However, I think that PHP resources on the web that hits by searching is mostly very old or mostly procedural style. I supposed this is mostly PHP5's feature or earlyer version.  This is useful for deep understanding for intermediate or professional, but for norvice, very boring stuff and complicated.

I'm provably intermediate level.

I write short tutorial in '@Test/autil.test.php' mainly for novice programmers of PHP in consideration.
This functions library bind many duplicated, verbose functions up to relatively simple function for daily use.
