# Autil
Vital functions for PHP7 development

# How to use
- Go to **'@Test/Autil.test.php'** file
- Read and follow instructions in that file.

# Who this is for
I write this functions for my personal use. However, This is also useful for other novice developer.

I think that PHP resources on the web that hit by searching is mostly very old or mostly procedural style. I supposed this is mostly PHP5's feature or earlyer version.  This is useful for deep understanding for intermediate or professional, but for norvice, very boring stuff and complicated.

I'm provably intermediate level.

I write short tutoial in '@Test/autil.test.php' to use this library. written mainly for novice PHP programmers into consideration.

This library bind many duplicated, verbose functions up to relatively simple functions for daily use.

I convinced that PHP is very norvice-friendly. And as you learn more, and then using many features about OOP, FP, that has been gradually added as time passing makes learning PHP more interesting!

I curretly has been implementing JavaScript-like OOP feature in PHP. This is very interesting.
